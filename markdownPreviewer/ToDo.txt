- Work how to parse markdown into HTML
-- Set up JS variables with h1 etc and work out the problematic areas
-- Problems with multi-line code - code block and lists. Block quote too maybe.
-- Create parsing function to deal with our input. Will need to separate the input line by line

- Add full screen button for editor and previewer

- When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should 
contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header 
(H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, 
an image, and bolded text.

- When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as 
HTML in the #preview element.

- MAKE IT LOOK NICE
