- Tighten up displaying of editor text in previewer window so less 'lag'
- Work how to parse markdown into HTML
- Add titles for the two boxes
- Add full screen button for editor
- Allow easy resizing of previewer

- When my markdown previewer first loads, the default text in the #editor field should 
contain valid markdown that represents at least one of each of the following elements: a header 
(H1 size), a sub header (H2 size), a link, inline code, a code block, a list item, a blockquote, 
an image, and bolded text.

- When my markdown previewer first loads, the default markdown in the #editor field should be rendered as 
HTML in the #preview element.
