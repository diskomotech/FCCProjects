What do the buttons do?

Clear just resets everything back to zero.

Numbers and decimal are simple inputs. We just want to save these somewhere
and wait for an operator.

Operators (/ X + -) maybe aren't anything special here - just like Numbers

Equals is the magic button. This means that we're finished with
input and want the output. It can only be pressed once.

So maybe we want to keep saving/logging inputs as long as possible and only
stop when the AC or equals button is pressed?


BIG STUFF
- Display inputs as pressed.
- Save input sequence as we go along in variable
- Transform input into output as soon as equals is pressed
- Reset everything when AC pressed


DETAILS
- When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a 
number to begin with multiple zeros.
- Use formula logic for calculation (look this up)
- When the decimal element is clicked, a . should append to 
the currently displayed value; two . in one number should not be accepted.
- I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, *, /) on 
numbers containing decimal points.
- If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation 
performed should be the last operator entered.
- Pressing an operator immediately following = should start a new 
calculation that operates on the result of the previous evaluation.
- My calculator should have several decimal places of precision 
when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, 
but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).
