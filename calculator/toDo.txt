BIG STUFF
- If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation performed should be the last operator entered. [Half solved
currently removing any decimal places entered which we don't want. Think something unexpected happening with join method]
- Something to disallow many zeroes in a row unless it's after a decimal point. [Half solved]
- Something to disallow more than one decimal in a given number. [Halfway there but still '1.2.4']
- Maybe think about how to save each single number in a var each time an operator is pressed? This might help solve the
decimal and zero validation problems. Another alternative would be to work on building component decimal and zero validation
functions and deploy those.
- Rework some of the addEventListener stuff into functions so repeating less code.

DETAILS
- Use formula logic for calculation (look this up)
- My calculator should have several decimal places of precision when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, 
but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).
