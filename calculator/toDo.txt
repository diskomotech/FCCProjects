BIG STUFF
- Something to disallow many zeroes in a row unless it's after a decimal point.
- Something to disallow more than one decimal in a given number. [Halfway there but still '1.2.4']
- Rework some of the addEventListener stuff into functions so repeating less code.

DETAILS
- Use formula logic for calculation (look this up)
- Two decimal points in one number should not be accepted.
- If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation 
performed should be the last operator entered.
- My calculator should have several decimal places of precision 
when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, 
but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).
