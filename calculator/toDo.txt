BIG STUFF
- Something to disallow many zeroes in a row unless it's after a decimal point. [Half solved]
- Something to disallow more than one decimal in a given number. [Halfway there but still '1.2.4']
- Maybe think about how to save each single number in a var each time an operator is pressed? This might help solve the
decimal and zero validation problems. Another alternative would be to work on building component decimal and zero validation
functions and deploy those.
- Rework some of the addEventListener stuff into functions so repeating less code.

DETAILS
- Use formula logic for calculation (look this up)
