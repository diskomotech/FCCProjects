BIG STUFF
- Display inputs as pressed.

DETAILS
- When inputting numbers, my calculator should not allow a 
number to begin with multiple zeros.
- Use formula logic for calculation (look this up)
- When the decimal element is clicked, a . should append to 
the currently displayed value; two . in one number should not be accepted.
- I should be able to perform any operation (+, -, *, /) on 
numbers containing decimal points.
- If 2 or more operators are entered consecutively, the operation 
performed should be the last operator entered.
- My calculator should have several decimal places of precision 
when it comes to rounding (note that there is no exact standard, 
but you should be able to handle calculations like 2 / 7 with reasonable precision to at least 4 decimal places).
