User Story #26: When a countdown reaches zero, a sound indicating 
that time is up should play. This should utilize an HTML5 audio tag and have a corresponding id="beep".

User Story #27: The audio element with id="beep" must be 1 second or longer.

User Story #28: The audio element with id of beep must stop playing and be rewound to the beginning 
when the element with the id of reset is clicked.

Remove any unnecessary HTML ID tags
Revert default time values (25:00 and 5:00)
Fix bug whereby on changeover from session to break (and vice versa) we display 0:00 and then 4:59. Never shows 5:00
Fix bug whereby timer display moves depending on the font width of the numbers
